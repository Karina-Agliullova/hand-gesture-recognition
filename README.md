# hand-gesture-recognition

Dataset:
- The dataset that has been used for this project is recorded with a 3D camera
- The dataset contains four different hand movements, moving up, down, right, and left
- Values x and y were extracted from each recorded dataset
- Values x and y were plotted on the scatterplot
- Values on the scatterplot were interpolated to 20 frames

KNN:
- The distance between the neighboring values was found with the use of Euclidean distance
- The dataset was trained and tested
